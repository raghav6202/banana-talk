    <h2>What's it about?</h2>
    <p>We have all seen the Despicable Me Series—and loved them, mainly because of the tiny, yellow, creatures
     called Minions. With their cute playfulness and words, they are loved by fans all over the world.</p>

<p>The Minions speaking their own language look super cute. The way they talk and their body language make them more
 lovable. We all like them, don’t we? Have you ever tried to mimic the way they talk? Wish to speak as they do? Well you can use this translation app to do so!!!</p>
